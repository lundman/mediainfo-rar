mediainfo-rar

This is a wrapper for "mediainfo" to be able to read content
information out of RAR archives. It requires a special build of
unrar, and will only work on -m0g (store) RAR archives.

I have not worked on this for some time, and was surprised to
get requests for it. So I felt it best to upload the latest
version I have, and if others have fixes we can have one
location for them.
